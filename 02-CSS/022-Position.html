      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying
      the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language
      such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or
      XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
      alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
    </p>
    <p id="tx2">
      CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation,
      including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve
      content accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more
      flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
      characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
      specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces
      complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css
      file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that
      share the file and its formatting.
    </p>
    <p id="tx3">
      Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the
      same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such
      as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen
      reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for
      alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
