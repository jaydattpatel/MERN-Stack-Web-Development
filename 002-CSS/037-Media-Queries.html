      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying
      the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language
      such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or
      XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
      alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to enable the separation
      of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This
      separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed]
      provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
      characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
      specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces
      complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css
      file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that
      share the file and its formatting.
