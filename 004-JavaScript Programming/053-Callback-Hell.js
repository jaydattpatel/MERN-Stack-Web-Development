Callback hell is a phenomenon where a Callback is called inside another Callback. It is the nesting of multiple Callbacks inside a function. If you look at the design of the code, it seems just like a pyramid. Thus the Callback hell is also referred to as the ‘Pyramid of Doom’.

Callback hell structurally is just a nesting of function calls inside a function. But, it becomes difficult to understand and keep track of the nesting once the size of the nesting is increased.
