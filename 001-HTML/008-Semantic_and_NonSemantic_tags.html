    <!-- Semantic elements clearly define the content they carry. Tags used to enclose them are called semantic tags. 
        Examples of Semantic elements: article, aside, details, figcaption, figure, footer, header, main, mark, nav, section, etc.

        Non-semantic elements don't tell any information about the content that they carry.
        Tags used to enclose these are called non-semantic tags.
        Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about itscontent.

            HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language
            for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines
            the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
            technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
            languages such as JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
            storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML
            describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
            included cues for its appearance.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML
            constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may
            be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
            structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such
            as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML
            elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags
            such as &lt;img> and &lt;input> directly introduce content into the
            page. Other tags such as &lt;p> and &lt;/p> surround and provide
            information about document text and may include sub-element tags.
            Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the
            content of the page.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as
            JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The
            inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World
            Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current
            maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over
            explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as
            HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the
            &lt;canvas> element, together with JavaScript.
