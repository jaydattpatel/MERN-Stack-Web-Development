            HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language
            for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines
            the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
            technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
            languages such as JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
            storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML
            describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
            included cues for its appearance.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML
            constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may
            be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
            structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such
            as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML
            elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags
            such as &lt;img> and &lt;input> directly introduce content into the
            page. Other tags such as &lt;p> and &lt;/p> surround and provide
            information about document text and may include sub-element tags.
            Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the
            content of the page.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as
            JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The
            inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World
            Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current
            maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over
            explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as
            HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the
            &lt;canvas> element, together with JavaScript.

            Photograph of Tim Berners-Lee in April 2009 Tim Berners-Lee in April
            2009 In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN,
            proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to
            use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing
            an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML
            and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year,
            Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau
            collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not
            formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee
            listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an
            encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]
          </p>
          <p>
            The first publicly available description of HTML was a document
            called "HTML Tags",[5] first mentioned on the Internet by Tim
            Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising
            the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the
            hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an
            in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based
            documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist
            in HTML 4.[8]
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and
            compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible web
            pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are
            defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or
            enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of
            the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR
            9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features of
            early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF
            command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible
            Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands
            were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually
            format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is
            based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather
            than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML
            has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was
            formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force
            (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an
            HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet
            Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML
            Document type definition to define the syntax.[9][10] The draft
            expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of
            the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images,
            reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful
            prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet Draft,
            "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested
            standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out
            forms.[11]
          </p>
          <p>
            After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF
            created an HTML Working Group. In 1995, this working group completed
            "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a
            standard against which future implementations should be based.[12]
          </p>
          <p>
            Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by
            competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been
            maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the
            World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).[13] In 2000, HTML became an
            international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published
            in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004,
            development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application
            Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable
            with the W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized on 28
            October 2014.[14]
